Be explicit about the format and level of detail you need in the response.
  Bad: "Read the README" (agent doesn't know what info you need)
  Good: "Read the README and tell me what testing framework this project uses"
  Bad: "Run cat foo.ts" (agent doesn't know if you want raw output or a summary)
  Good: "Run cat foo.ts and return the raw output verbatim"
